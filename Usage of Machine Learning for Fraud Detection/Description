With the banking and finance companies facilitating online transactions, large amounts of
data being transferred to financial sectors, commercial payments have become much more
vulnerable to fraud and risks, leading to data leakage and personal data being revealed to
fraudsters, resulting in massive losses for both organizations and customers. In the year
2018, a credit card scam cost the world $24.26 billion. These scams have resulted in
enormous financial losses for many unaware victims. The most common targets of these
scams are elderly people who are less technologically savvy. This forces enterprises to use
a high degree of security and data management solutions such as machine learning, which
are sufficiently effective to deal with highly delicate information, find fraud, and identify
abnormal behavioral patterns in this data. This study discusses a comparative analysis of
three varient Machine Learning models: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and
K-Nearest Neighbors, and determines which model best detects fraudulent transactions.
