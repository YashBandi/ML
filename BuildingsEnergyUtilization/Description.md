Buildings are among the major patrons of electricity, so itâ€™s critical to prepare various techniques for helping the minimization of electricity usage.
Predicting heating and cooling demands in structures, is critical for constructing energy-efficient arrangements.
The proposed estimation approaches were evaluated using Linear Regression,Decision Tree,zand RandomForest algorithms.
Determining the most suitable model for predicting energy consumption among Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
Dataset: 'energy_efficiency_data.csv' dataset from Kaggle
The best model is determined based on the RMSE and R^2 values of Heating Load and Cooling Load for all the Machine Learning Models.
