This study looks on the effectiveness of advanced machine learning approaches in improving stock market forecasting accuracy. 
The study employs Long Short-Term Memory networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Random Forest classifiers on a dataset collected from a public source. 
The dataset is thoroughly visualized to discover feature interactions and correlations after painstaking data preparation, including handling missing values and outliers.
The major goal is to assess model performance across various train-test splits, revealing light on their ability to capture complicated stock market dynamics.
The study assesses model performance across various train-test splits, with accuracy as the major metrics.
Research Question: Which model is best for Stock market Prediction in between Random Forest, CNN and LSTM models? 
Random Forest classifier consistently delivers competitive accuracy across multiple splits, according to the results.
